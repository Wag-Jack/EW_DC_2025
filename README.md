Welcome to the Design Challenge for Engineers Week 2025!

Challenge:
Given here is a respository that you need to go through and find any and all bugs. This can be anything up to and including:
- merge conflicts between 'main' and 'dev' branches
- bugs with communicating between the frontend and backend
- issues with server setup
- etc.

The goal is to fix these errors and resolve merge conflicts so that, in the end, you're able to enter a password and display the Engineers Week logo, thus signaling you successfully fixed all issues!
